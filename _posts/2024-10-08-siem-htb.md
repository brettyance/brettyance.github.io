# HackTheBox's SIEM Foundation
I was frustrated when I learned Sunday evening that HackTheBox's weekly reset is Monday 00:00 UTC, but that's my fault for waiting until the final few hours in the first place. Now I know, and I won't be making that mistake again. What's more, I'm hoping that I'll be able to maintain progress close to daily. If I can't accomplish a full lesson each day, a few minutes will suffice.

In any case, I've successfully completed the first module in HackTheBox covering the ELK stack. [Here's the badge!](https://academy.hackthebox.com/achievement/badge/5c90caa4-85d9-11ef-864f-bea50ffe6cb4) My attention is drawn in several directions, so I'm not entirely decided on what to do first, but I'd like to get Splunk certified as well as finishing the HTB CDSA certification.
