# HackTheBox's SIEM Foundation
I was frustrated when I learned Sunday evening that HackTheBox's weekly reset is Monday 00:00 UTC, but that's my fault for waiting until the final few hours in the first place. Now I know, and I won't be making that mistake again. What's more, I'm hoping that I'll be able to maintain progress close to daily. If I can't accomplish a full lesson each day, a few minutes will suffice.
